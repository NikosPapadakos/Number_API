This is a project exercise from udemy's course "The complete web developer in 2021 : Zero to Mastery"
Made with react.

		! IMPORTANT !
API search won't work on githubpages as numberapi.com is an http request and github uses https.
(Error mixed content). Sadly number api doesn't have a https request for their API.
